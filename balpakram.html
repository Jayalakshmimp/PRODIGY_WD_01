<p><i><h3>Balpakram National Park is located in Meghalaya and is home to one of the world’s most endangered creatures, the Lesser Panda, also known as the Red Panda. Balpakram is known for its forested canyon-cum-gorge, designated as a National Park. The Balpakram plateau and surrounding woodlands are also part of the park. Balpakram is a land of constant winds, with tigers, elephants, bison, black bears, leopards, and sambar deer inhabiting an area of around 220 square kilometres. It is located near Baghmara in Meghalaya’s South Garo Hills District. Along the banks of the Simsang River, the western half of the park borders the Siju bird sanctuary</h3></i></p>
